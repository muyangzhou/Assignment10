Our experiment results were unexpected. Most of the experiments resulted in a compressed file which
was larger than the original. After analyzing the results, we believe that the reason that some of
the files have become larger is because under a certain size, compressing is un-optimal, simply
because of the size of the header, magic number, header data, etc. that precedes the actual
compressed data. The Huffman encoding worked especially well on txt and html files, with most of the
files within the BooksAndHTML folder being successfully compressed into smaller files.For the most
part, larger files compressed better and faired a better compression percentage than that of small
files. However, the Waterloo folder, with all .tif files did poorly under Huffman Encoding. Every
file was unsuccessfully compressed and larger than the original. TIFF files often expand under
Huffman encoding because they are usually pre-compressed. Trying to re-compress these files adds
data like the Huffman trees, without significantly reducing the data size. Similar ideas apply for
files like .jpg or .mp3 files which are already compressed. The last folder we compressed was the
calgary file, which its files mostly increased in size after compression. This leads me to believe
that the contents within such files are not primarily text, and instead pre-compressed data.
